# N-Queens Genetic Algorithm

This Python program utilizes a genetic algorithm to tackle the N-Queens problem. The N-Queens problem represents a well-known combinatorial optimization challenge, where the objective is to strategically place N chess queens on an N×N chessboard, ensuring that no two queens threaten each other's positions.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.x

## Instructions for Submission

1. Download the program files from the provided zip folder or repository.

2. Extract the contents of the zip folder to your desired directory.

3. Open a terminal or command prompt.

4. Navigate to the directory where the extracted program files are located.

5. Run the program with the following command:

   python3 genetic_algorithm_nqueens.py

7. Follow the prompts to enter the parameters for the genetic algorithm:
- Board size (positive integer): Size of the chessboard (number of queens).
- Population size (positive integer): Size of the population of solutions.
- Number of max generations (positive integer): Maximum number of generations.
- Mutation rate (positive float between 0 and 1): Probability of mutation for each solution.
- Max number of iterations with same fitness (positive integer): Stagnation threshold.

7. The program will execute the genetic algorithm to find the best solution for the N-Queens problem.

8. Once the algorithm completes, it will display the best solution found, its fitness (number of clashes), and the time taken to find the solution.

9. If you're interested in viewing additional statistics and results, explore the "Stats" folder within the provided zip file. This folder contains results for 100 boards of various sizes (4, 8, 12, 16, 20, 24, 28, and 32) with mutation rates of 0.01, 0.05, and 0.1. Each result set is stored in folders named "100_0.1," "100_0.05," and "100_0.01."
